### Gatsby - Shopify Storefront Clothing Store

###### Summary

A client needed a fast way to get an e-commerce store running. The compan is a custom t-shirt company specializing in fundraising campaigns for local organizations.

Gatsby is my go-to for handling static site builds and I had seen it used with Shopify Storefronts. It was a perfect match as the client was able to manage the backend inventory, create collections, and manage orders. I was able to dynamically create pages for each product, use React Context to create a shopping cart, and integrate Apollo Server so that customers could make a note for the order.


Triggering build.
